# Groceries Unmemorized

Grocery list to ease shopping for users.

## Description

Grocery's Unmemorized is a to-do list-esque program developed using Python and Tkinter. Users can add grocery items to their list by typing in the item. The program accepts an amount and item input.
The algorithm checks to see if the same item is inputted, in which case it will increment only the amount of the repeated item. To remove items from the list, click on the item in question
from the list and click the "remove" button. There is a restart and quit button to allow users to quit and restart the program.(NOTE: Restart only resets the Python Shell)

## Getting Started
